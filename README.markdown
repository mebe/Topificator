# Topificator #

Topificator is a Rails 1.1.6 application that turns channel topic changes in IRC to RSS feeds. Users login with their IRC Nickserv username and password to manage their subscriptions.

Uses [Anope's](http://www.anope.org/) SQL module to make the IRC stuff readable, so won't work on a public network.

Actually my first Rails application ever finishedâ€¦
